(registered 2015-07-21, last updated 2015-07-21)

Scheme name:  rediss

Status:  Provisional

Applications/protocols that use this scheme name:
  This scheme is used by some Redis database client libraries to
  designate the Redis database to connect to via RESP (REdis
  Serialization Protocol) over TLS (RFC 5246), and in some cases to set
  additional connection parameters of the client library.  Redis client
  libraries implement RESP as defined in "Redis Protocol
  specification".  This URI scheme is not part of that specification.
  The scheme name (with an extra "s" at the end compared to the redis:
  URI scheme) was apparently named by analogy to HTTPS (RFC 2818), and
  is not a typo.

Scheme syntax:
  Example: rediss://user:secret@localhost:6379/0?foo=bar&qux=baz

  Other than the difference in scheme name, the rediss: scheme uses the
  same syntax as the redis: scheme.  See the IANA registration for the
  redis: scheme for details.

Scheme semantics:
  This scheme is used to designate Redis databases that may be accessed
  via RESP over TLS (RFC 5246).
  URIs using this scheme are dereferenced by connecting to the
  designated Redis server via RESP over TLS and then issuing
  corresponding AUTH and/or SELECT commands if a password and/or
  database number (respectively) were specified.

  Other than the usage of TLS, the rediss: scheme has the same
  semantics as the redis: scheme.  See the IANA registration for the
  redis: scheme for details.

Encoding considerations:
  Unknown, use with care.

Interoperability considerations:
  All interoperability considerations for the redis: scheme are also
  applicable to the rediss: scheme.  See the IANA registration for the
  redis: scheme for details.

  At the time of writing this registration, support for the rediss:
  scheme is significantly less widespread than support for the redis:
  scheme.

  Some Redis client libraries (such as ServiceStack.Redis), instead of
  using the rediss: scheme, use the redis: URI scheme along with a
  query URI component key-value pair with the key "ssl" that controls
  the usage of TLS.  The key-value pair's values are "true" and
  "false", which respectively enable or disable TLS.
  Example: redis://localhost/0?ssl=true

Security considerations:
  Not fully known, use with care.

  Most security considerations for the redis: URI scheme also apply to
  the rediss: URI scheme.  See the IANA registration for the redis:
  scheme for details.

  In contrast to plain RESP, using RESP over TLS (RFC 5246) as
  mentioned in "Redis Encryption", along with public key certificates,
  can provide assurances of peer entity authentication (or merely host
  authentication if client certificates are not used), confidentiality,
  and data integrity.  It is theoretically possible to use client
  certificates as an alternative Redis-level authentication/login
  mechanism in place of the username/password-based "AUTH" RESP
  command.
