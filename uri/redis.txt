Scheme name:  redis

Status:  Provisional

Applications/protocols that use this scheme name:
  This scheme is used by some Redis database client libraries to
  designate the Redis database to connect to, and in some cases to set
  additional connection parameters of the client library.  Redis client
  libraries implement the RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol) defined
  in "Redis Protocol specification".  This URI scheme is not part of
  that specification.

Scheme syntax:
  Example: redis://user:secret@localhost:6379/0?foo=bar&qux=baz

  This scheme uses a profile of the RFC 3986 generic URI syntax.
  All URI fields after the scheme are optional.
  The "userinfo" field uses the traditional "user:password" format.

  Expressed using RFC 5234 ABNF, the "path" grammar production from
  RFC 3986 is overridden as follows:
    path         = [ path-slashed ]
                 ; path is optional
    path-slashed = "/" [ db-number ]
                 ; exactly zero or one path segments
    db-number    = "0" / nz-num
                 ; nonnegative decimal integer with no leading zeros
    nz-num       = NZDIGIT *DIGIT
                 ; positive decimal integer with no leading zeros
    NZDIGIT      = %x31-39
                 ; the digits 1-9

Scheme semantics:
  This scheme is used to designate Redis databases that may be accessed
  via RESP.
  URIs using this scheme are dereferenced by connecting to the
  designated Redis server via RESP and then issuing corresponding AUTH
  and/or SELECT commands if a password and/or database number
  (respectively) were specified.

  If absent, the default value of the "host" URI field is:
    "localhost" (or equivalent)
  If absent, the default value of the "port" URI field is:
    6379
    (see the corresponding entry in the Service Name and Transport
    Protocol Port Number Registry)
  The database number to use for the Redis SELECT command comes from
  either the "db-number" portion of the URI (described in the previous
  section) or the value from the key-value pair from the "query" URI
  field with the key "db".  If neither of these are present, the
  default database number is 0.
  The password to use for the Redis AUTH command comes from either the
  password portion of the "userinfo" URI field or the value from the
  key-value pair from the "query" URI field with the key "password".
  If neither of these are present, the client ought not to issue an
  initial AUTH command.
  If a future version of Redis adds support for multi-user
  authentication (e.g. if RCP1 gets accepted), it's suggested that the
  username to use when authenticating be obtained from the username
  portion of the "userinfo" URI field.
  The semantics of "query" URI field key-value pairs other than those
  previously mentioned are implementation-defined.

Encoding considerations:
  Unknown, use with care.

Interoperability considerations:
  The "fragment" URI field has no known meaning or usage.  Unless it
  becomes meaningful in the future, omitting it is strongly advised.
  Redis' current optional authentication mechanism does not employ a
  username, but this might change in the future (e.g. if RCP1 gets
  accepted).  Until/unless that happens: URI producers are advised to
  leave the username portion of the "userinfo" URI field blank; URI
  consumers are advised to be aware of the future possibility of
  non-blank username portions of URIs; attempting to use the username
  portion of URIs for any purpose other than specifying the username to
  use when authenticating to the Redis server is strongly advised
  against.
  The "query" URI field is used to specify client-library-
  implementation-specific connection parameters and is therefore not
  portable.  Using it without knowledge of which specific client
  library is going to be used ought to be avoided.
  The meaning of "path" URI field values that do not conform to the
  "db-number" grammar have no known meaning or usage.  Using such
  values ought to be avoided.
  If both a "db-number" value and a "query" URI field key-value pair
  with the key "db" are present, the semantics for what Redis database
  number to use are not well-defined.  Such situations therefore ought
  to be avoided.
  If both the password portion of the "userinfo" URI field and a
  "query" URI field key-value pair with the key "password" are present,
  the semantics for what password to use for authentication are not
  well-defined.  Such situations therefore ought to be avoided.

Security considerations:
  Not fully known, use with care.
  Since this is merely a registration of the redis: URI scheme and not
  an RFC defining RESP, full security considerations for RESP itself
  are beyond the scope of this document.  Considerations in this
  document will be mostly limited to the redis: URI scheme itself.
  Some considerations for Redis and RESP may be found in the "Redis
  Security" and "Redis Encryption" documents.
  As redis: URIs might contain authentication credentials or designate
  Redis servers which allow unauthenticated access, care ought to be
  taken to not leak the credentials to unauthorized persons, e.g. by
  outputting the URIs in logs or error messages.
  According to "Redis Security": "Redis is designed to be accessed by
  trusted clients inside trusted environments.  This means that usually
  it is not a good idea to expose the Redis instance directly to the
  internet or, in general, to an environment where untrusted clients
  can directly access the Redis [server]."  Accordingly, exposing
  redis: URIs on the internet or to untrusted clients is not advisable.
  If Redis' authentication mechanism adds support for usernames (e.g.
  if RCP1 gets accepted) in the future, some older services which
  ignore the username portion of URIs and some newer services which are
  aware of Redis usernames might interpret a given Redis URI with a
  username differently from each other.  This might make the system
  vulnerable to privilege escalation or other related attacks.
  "Redis Security" advises the usage of strong and very long passwords
  to defend against brute-force password-guessing attacks.  redis: URIs
  can therefore be correspondingly long, and users are advised to be
  prepared to handle very long URIs and password values.
  redis: URIs may refer to hosts using domain names.  The domain name
  resolution process is subject to its own set of security
  considerations (RFC 4033).
  RESP is a simple unencrypted protocol and thus does not provide
  assurances of confidentiality or data integrity.  Combined with
  RESP's username/password authentication mechanism, the considerations
  in RFC 3552 (BCP 72), Section 4.1.1 are applicable.  "Redis Security"
  advises the usage of additional specific security measures to help
  mitigate the weakness of Redis' authentication mechanism.
  Using RESP over TLS (RFC 5246), as mentioned in "Redis Encryption",
  along with public key certificates, can provide assurances of peer
  entity authentication (or merely host authentication if client
  certificates are not used), confidentiality, and data integrity.  It
  is theoretically possible to use client certificates as an
  alternative Redis-level authentication/login mechanism in place of
  the username/password-based "AUTH" RESP command.  Apparently named by
  analogy to HTTPS (RFC 2818), the rediss: URI scheme (yes, two "s"es,
  not a typo) has been used by some clients to designate RESP over TLS.
  Other than the usage of TLS, the rediss: URI scheme is not known to
  have any differences from the redis: URI scheme.
  redis: URIs may indirectly slightly facilitate denial of service
  attacks against Redis servers by making it easier to communicate the
  connection details of targeted Redis servers/databases among systems
  conducting such attacks.
